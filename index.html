          <p>Marc perservered in his recovery journey for a long year of physical rehabilitation, and overcame every obstacle to work his way back to competition strength. After 9 months out of action he stepped back into the spotlight in the 3rd round of 2021. He quickly built back his confidence and came to win the 8th round of 2021 at his favourite Sachsenring circuit.</p>
    
          <p>Marc was already inspirational in his world-class talent and determination, but this incredible comeback puts him amongst some of the world's greatest athletes; sporting heroes who make their return after battling serious, potentially career-ending injuries to continue persuing their passion.</p>
    
          <p>The incredible strength of character to persevere through the devastation of injury, and come back on top is nothing short of awe-inspiring, and goes to show the power of belief and commitment.</p>
